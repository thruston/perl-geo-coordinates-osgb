Geo::Coordinates::OSGB
Geo::Coordinates::OSGB::Grid
Geo::Coordinates::OSGB::Maps
----------------------------

Routines to convert latitude and longitude coordinates to and from transverse
Mercator grid references. The routines are designed for use with the British
national grid.

The OSGB module provides routines to convert between latitude/longitude
coordinates in the WGS84 or OSGB36 models and the British National Grid.
The Grid module includes some useful extra routines to parse and format
grid references in a variety of popular forms (including which map your
point appears on). The Maps module provides data for British maps.

Note that due to the nature of this type of conversion, the conversions are 
only really useful in the vicinity of the British Isles.  If you are elsewhere 
on the planet you need an implementation designed for your neighbourhood.

CHANGES:  please note that if you are upgrading from V2.09 or earlier
the semantics and interface have changed slightly.  

- The default lat/lon is now WGS84

- The functions `shift_ll_into_WGS84` and `shift_ll_from_WGS84` are 
  no longer provided (or needed)
 
- The functions formerly provided by OSTN02.pm are integrated into
  OSGB.pm, so the subroutines `OSGB36_to_ETRS89` and `ETRS89_to_OSGB36` 
  are no longer provided (or needed)

- The functions to parse and format grid references are moved to 
  OSGB/Grid.pm

- The functions to parse and format lat/lon are removed (since they are
  better provided by other modules)

For more details, see the section on "Upgrading" in Background.pod

INSTALLATION

This package installs in the regular Perl way.  You don't need the C compiler
and as far as I know there are no platform dependencies.  Either use your
local package tool, or just try

  [sudo] perl -MCPAN -e "install Geo::Coordinates::OSGB" 
  
For the die hards, the package can also be installed by
hand; just unzip it to some temporary home, then do the usual thing:

        Perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        [sudo] make install

The full suite of tests takes about 2 seconds on my machine. 
You may or may not need sudo depending on how you have set up your system.

DEPENDENCIES

None.
