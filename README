Geo::Coordinates::OSGB
Geo::Coordinates::OSGB::Grid
Geo::Coordinates::OSGB::Maps
----------------------------
 
Geo::Coordinates::OSGB provides routines to convert latitude and
longitude coordinates to and from transverse Mercator grid references;
the routines are designed for use with the British national grid.
 
- The OSGB module provides routines to convert between
  latitude/longitude coordinates in the WGS84 or OSGB36 models and the
  British National Grid.
 
- The Grid module includes some useful extra routines to parse and
  format grid references in a variety of popular forms (including which
  map your point appears on). 
 
- The Maps module provides data for British maps.
 
Note that due to the nature of this type of conversion, the conversions
are only really useful in the vicinity of the British Isles.  If you are
elsewhere on the planet you need an implementation designed for your
neighbourhood.
 

INSTALLATION

This package installs in the regular Perl way.  You don't need the C
compiler and as far as I know there are no platform dependencies.
Either use your local package tool, or just try

  [sudo] perl -MCPAN -e "install Geo::Coordinates::OSGB" 
  
For the die hards, the package can also be installed by hand; just unzip
it to some temporary home, then do the usual thing:

        Perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        [sudo] make install

The full suite of tests takes about 1 second on my machine.  You may or
may not need sudo depending on how you have set up your system.
