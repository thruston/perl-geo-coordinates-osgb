Revision history for Perl extension Geo::Coordinates::OSGB

2.13 February 2016

    - Faster OSTN02 data look up 

    - format_grid now supports ... { form => 'SS' } ... to get just the grid square.

    - Updated examples with proper documentation and improved plotting of maps

    - Minor change in t/08out_of_range.t and t/13edge.t tests to allow for Perl
      with "long double" enabled.  Corresponding updates to documentation.
      This does not affect any function; I've simply made the tests more
      robust.  I should add that "long doubles" do not appear to benefit this
      module at all.  The results and accuracy that I get are the same with
      "long doubles" but everything runs about 10% slower.

2.12 January 2016

    - Re-worked the handling of points near the boundary of the OSTN02 polygon,
      to avoid a potential loop in rare cases.  This is unlikely to affect any
      transformations with real coordinates (unless you spend a lot of time in
      boats about 10km offshore), but avoids some problems in my testing with
      random grid points.

    - Simplified OSTN02 data access.  Removed the OSGM02 height part of the
      data as this is no longer used.  This makes the module somewhat smaller
      and a little faster to load. 

    - Added user interface to approximate conversion routines for quick Helmert
      transformations:  "grid_to_ll_helmert" and "ll_to_grid_helmert" 

    - Fixed a small bug in "parse_grid", so that it allows '/' character in map
      sheet names, and therefore works with sheet names like: 'B:110/OL44'

    - Corrected structure of POD documentation in Maps.pm and Background.pm

    - Simplified testing of random grid references to give more reliable
      results.  Added more tests based on OS transformations, and to prove
      some edge conditions.
       

2.11 January 2016

    - Small bug fixes only

    - Removed the 'r' switch from the single use of the 'tr' function. This accidentally
      created a dependency on perl 5.14 which caused several CPAN testers to fail 2.10.

    - Added 'use 5.008' to main modules: everything should now work on perl 5.8 or better.

    - Added note about accuracy of OSTN02 in grid square HP (far north of Shetland) and changed
      the random round-trip tests to avoid this square.  For reasons I do not understand, the 
      accuracy of round trip conversion with this implementation of OSTN02 is within a few mm 
      for most of the country, but suddenly drops to an average of about 25m in grid square HP.

    - Minor clean up of pod formatting in a couple of places


2.10 January 2016

    - Complete simplification and restructure of the entire module

    - Geo::Coordinates::OSGB now provides only: 

        grid_to_ll
        ll_to_grid

    - WGS84 is assumed as the default ellipsoid shape
    - OSTN02 data is automatically used where necessary providing much a simpler interface
    - New Helmert transformation routines automatically used outside OSTN02 coverage
    
    - New module Geo::Coordinates::OSGB::Grid provides routines to parse and format grid references
      -- general purpose "format_grid" for all formatting
      -- general purpose "parse_grid" for all parsing
    
    - New module Geo::Coordinates::OSGB::Maps provides outlines, bounding boxes, and titles for OSGB maps


2.09 October 2015

    - Improved and generalized handling of maps to allow for multiple series, insets, and irregular boundaries
    - New generic functions "format_grid_map" and "parse_map_grid" to replace the Landranger-specific functions
    - Complete insets and extensions to sheet boundaries for Landranger maps
    - Complete sheet boundaries for old One Inch 7th series maps
    - Complete sheet boundaries for Explorer series of 1:25000 maps
    - Reorganized distribution: 
      -- example scripts are in examples/
      -- map definitions are in maps/
    - Minor improvements to precision

2.08 June 2015

    - reduced size of the data table in OSTN02 and improved loading time

    - new "random_grid" function in OSGB returns a random point on a random Landranger map.
      See "gbguessr.pl" script for example use to compare OS maps and Google maps on same point
    
    - removed old kml generating example script
    - revised and improved documentation

2.07  June 2015

    - removed dependency on Math::Trig for tan and sec functions
    - removed unnecessary package variables from OSTN02
    - simplified unpacking of data in OSTN02

2.06  October 2013

    - removed precise URL for theory paper - the OS keep moving it about, so just Google for the name
    - removed non-ascii characters from POD in OSGB.pm to avoid encoding issue
    
2.05  31 August 2013

    - Put blank lines back in OSTN02 to prevent pod2html taking an age during install
    - Refactored OSGB and OSTN02 lightly to conform more closely to "Perl Best Practices"
    - corrected corner coordinate data for Landranger sheets 1 and 185

2.04  6 November 2008

    - Rework search of OSTN02 data to improve performance and reliability
    - Add range checking of OSTN02 coordinates
    - Compress OSTN02 data to hexadecimal form to speed up loading
    - Change selection of data in 03random.t test to avoid off-the-sheet errors
    - Minor tidy up changes in OSGB
    - Complete overhaul of the documentation
    - removed old "coco.pl" example script
    - added new example script to show all "000 000" grid references

2.03 Not released

2.02 22 September 2008

    - Removed irritating degree sign from verbose test message (no functional change)
    - Make parse_landranger_grid behave better in scalar context
    - Improve useability of parse_grid
    - Correct GR of SW corner of Landranger Sheet 3
    - Further optimize handling of OSTN02 data to prevent data parsing at pod2man time
    - Improve documentation
    - More example scripts (with notes)

2.01 6 September 2007

    - Optimized handling of OSTN02 data to reduce memory requirements *and* speed it up.

2.00 4 September 2007

    - New version with routines to do adjustment to and from latitude and
      longitude coordinates based on the (now ubiquitous) WGS84 model, for
      more compatible use with GPS receivers and Google Earth and similar
      tools.

    - Includes not only fast approximate adjustment as used in most
      coordinate tools and devices, but also the definitive-but-slow OSTN02
      transformation based on OSGB data

    - Step version number

    - POD completely revised


1.07 7 September 2005

       - corrected link in POD

       - various minor documentation corrections

1.06 16 May 2005

       - general clean up

       - made the format and parse routines external to avoid spaghetti connections

       - added support for grid references in GPS format (eg TQ 32342 24312)

1.05 29 March 2005

       - Not released

1.04  29 September 2004

        - corrected a bug in grid2ll, where long/lat values with 0 degrees
          were always printed as positive in scalar form The problem was that
          -1 * 0 = +0 in Perl (as it says in the Camel book somewhere).

        - added simple coco.pl script to provide command line coordinate
          conversions.

        - actually implemented the long-promised map2ll and ll2map functions
          as well as map2grid and grid2map for completeness.  With these
          functions you can convert to and from coordinates in a more useable
          form, such as "OS Sheet 43; 875123".

        - added a demonstration script --- plotmaps.pl --- which will produce
          a pretty index of the Landranger maps, showing the GB coast line
          and the large grid squares.  The output is in PostScript.  Use
          GhostScript to process it.  A PDF version of the output is also
          included.

        - added a useful file with all the names and other details of the
          Landranger Sheets

1.03  18 December 2002
        - changed name for CPAN release
        - improved ll2grid function
        - new ll2map and map2ll functions


1.02  November 13, 2002
        - No changes to code, just tidied the documentation

0.01  Fri Mar  2 19:05:50 2001
